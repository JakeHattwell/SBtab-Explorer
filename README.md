## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for working with SBtab Files.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3
* The `openpyxl` python library is required to use SBtab Explorer. It can be used using the following command in command prompt/terminal
```
python -m pip install openpyxl
```

### Installation

To install SBtab Explorer, either download the repo as a zip, or clone the repo to a local location by opening a shell window in the desired install location and using:

```
git clone https://github.com/JakeHattwell/SBtab-Explorer.git
```

To use SBtab Explorer, run the `SBtabExplorer.py` file either through double-click or by running the following command in the directory the files are located in.
```
python SBtabExplorer.py
```
## Usage

#### Usage: Loading models

SBtab Explorer comes with a version of the [WormJam](ttps://gh.wormjam.life) genome scale model as a demo dataset.

To load the WormJam model, use the file menu, and select either **Open TSV** or **Open XLSX**. This will open a folder selection window.

Navigate to the WormJam folder in the install location and select the relevant filetype folder, and press Select Folder.

SBtab Explorer will then load your model for use.

#### Usage: Editing models
Models can be searched using the search bar. Opening a search result will open an editor in a new tab.

On the left of the editor window is the link pane. The link pane has references to all of the entries that reference that particular entry.

New entries can be added using the **Tools** button. The list of available entry types will be autopopulated based on what SBtab files were present during the import.

**Note that saving an entry does not save your changes, only stores the changes in the open model. To save your work permanently, use the file menu.**

#### Usage: Saving models
To save your changes, use the `Save` or `Save As` options from the file menu.

## Email Submission
SBtab Explorer has a template available for Email Submission of updated SBtab files for curation efforts.

In the installation directory, edit the `settings.py` file in a text editor, changing the following variables:
```
EMAIL_SUBMISSION_ENABLED = True
EMAIL_SUBMISSION_ADDRESS = 'Target Email Address'
```

This will enable email submission of curation files and a `Submit` option will be added to the file menu.

Upon clicking Submit, a new prefilled email will opened, and the user can attach the relevant files to the email, before sending it.
